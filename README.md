### About
-------------
This is a small project I made in Godot 4. It's a remake of the old Shooting range games I made way back in Python and Lua. This is the final version. <br>
I tried to add much more detail and animations to this project and I'm quite happy with it. <br>
The game uses a "script" system for each level, which means it's really easy to add new waves and script them. <br>

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot v4.0.3. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.

### Credits
-------------
I will only list some credits here, as the full list is in the game itself, in the Credits menu. <br>
Thanks to DipShtick (Varga) testing. <br>
Graphical assets were made by Kenney (https://kenney.nl/) <br>
